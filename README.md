# LogTree

The purpose of this project was to build a binary hash tree (Merkle tree) for signing log files and verifying logfile entries.

The LogTreeTest class enables to run the implementation by providing a log file and optionally a log file entry and trusted root hash as program arguments.

An external slf4j library is used for logging.
